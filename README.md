# boston-main-streets
Given an address, we find the nearest intersection point. From that intersection point, we proceed to find the businesses
within the given radius of the intersection. This data will later be used to get meaningful insights such as, but not limited
to, how a particular business structure within a given radius possibly contributes to the gentrification within the
area of interest.

How to run:

if you want to get the intersections and businesses in seperate files: first run "get_intersections.py" and then "yelp_script.py". 

if you just want to get the businesses, then run "unified.py"
